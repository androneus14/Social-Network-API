## Description

Our Challenge this week was to build an API for a social network application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. We needed to use Express.js for the routing, use a MongoDB database and the Mongoose ODM.

## User Story

    AS A social media startup
    I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
    SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Acceptance Criteria

    GIVEN a social network API
    WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
    THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
    WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
    THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
    WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
    THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
    WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
    THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list

## Installation

To install this application, we need to either run npm start (npm install first for dependencies) or node server.js through the terminal.
